# 
# __Brief description:__<br>
# The project goal is to write a 'data science blog post' about Airbnb listings in Boston and Seattle that answers three questions. To meet the goal questions needs to be phrased and data analysis shall be conducted to answer the questions.
# 
# __Questions:__
# 1. To which extent is data available on listings of Boston and Seattle Aribnbs? Is there a significant difference in the availability of data for the two cities?
# 2. Does more information provision correlate with more favorable outcomes for a host? E.g. better prices, more reviews or better review score values
# 3. Are there significant differences between the two citiesâ€™ apartment offers?

# ## 2) &nbsp; &nbsp; Data Understanding
# 

# ### 2.1) &nbsp; &nbsp; Access the data

# ## 4) &nbsp; &nbsp; Data Modeling

# ### 4.1) &nbsp; &nbsp; Question 1:

# >__Observations__:
# >- There are 4 features for which the proportion of missing values is around zero: `listing_id`, `seattle` (added during Data preparation), `date` and `available`, of which the latter two stem from the `Calendar` datasets.
# >- `Price` is the feature which is not fully complete in the dataset but the proportion of missing values is below 50% for it.
# >- There is a large set of features for which the extent of missing values is around 60% (marked by blue).
# >- There are features for which the dataset contains hardly any data entries, e.g. `square_feet`.

# #### 4.1.2) &nbsp; &nbsp; Assess missing data per feature by city

# > __Comment:__<br>
#     >- There are only 2 features in the joint and merged dataset of which no values are missing: `listing_id` and `seattle`.

#     >    - `has_availability`
#     >    - `jurisdiction_names`, <br>
#     >as for Boston, there are no data entries for these fields.

# #### 4.1.3) &nbsp; &nbsp; Missing value threshold vs. number of features

plt.xlabel("Maximum proportion of missing values")
plt.title("Number of remaining features by proportion of missing values tolerated per feature")
plt.ylabel('No. of remaining features')

plt.savefig("threashold_features.png")
plt.show()


# >__Conclusion:__<br>
# Keeping the proportion of missing values in features below 60% would result in a vary narrow set of features available. Thus there is need for making a compromise in the proportion of missing values tolerated to keep a set of features wide enough to make some reasonable analyses on it.

# #### 4.1.4) &nbsp; &nbsp; Missing values per record

# ##### Analyze - missing values per record

# In[68]:


#See the distribution of the proportion of missing values per row
df['missing_values'].describe()/df.shape[1]


# >__Comment__: There is a very limited number of rows where the proportion of missing values is below 90%. It reaches somewhere between 25 and 50% of the rows.

# ##### Visualize - Missing values per record

# >__Obbservation:__
# - There are 200,000 records at most for which almost all features contain data (missing 1-4 features / record at most)
# - There are more than 1.4 million rows in the dataset for which more than 80 out of 96 features have missing values.
# - For the remaining records, around 5 - 30 features are missing.

# In[70]:


#Distribution of missing values per record by city

plt.savefig("missing_per_record_by_city.png")


# >__Observations:__
# - There are significant differences in the distribution of missing features per record between Boston and Seattle.
# - There are far more records, around 200,000 for Seattle which contain almost all features (vs. around 0 for Boston)
# - There are far more records, around 500,000 for Seattle which contain at least ~80 features  out of 96 (vs. less than 100,000 for Boston)
# - There are significantly more records for Boston where almost all features are missing, cca. 900,000 (vs. cca. 700,000 for Seattle).

# ### 4.2) &nbsp; &nbsp; Question 2:
# Does more information provision correlate with more favorable outcomes for a host? E.g. better prices, more reviews or better review score values.

# >__Assumption:__ <br> more information available makes an accommodation more attractive --> higher prices or better reviews

# #### 4.2.1) Price by number of missing values per record
# ##### Analysis by visualization

# In[71]:


df.plot(x = 'missing_values', y = 'price', kind = 'scatter')
plt.title('Price by number of missing values in a record')
plt.xlabel('Missing values per record')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.savefig("price_by_missing_values_per_record.png")


# >__Comment:__<br>
#     Based on a simple visual approach, and disregarding seemingly outlier values, there is no clear correlation between the number of missing values of a record and the corresponding price level. However, there might be more relatively expensive accommodations among the ones with the most missing values.

# #### 4.2.2) Number of reviews by number of missing values per record
# ##### Analysis by visualization

# In[72]:


df.plot(x = 'missing_values', y = 'number_of_reviews', kind = 'scatter', color = 'mediumvioletred')
plt.title('Number of reviews by number of missing values in a record')
plt.xlabel('Missing values per record')
plt.ylabel('No. of reviews')
plt.savefig("no_of_reviews_by_missing_values_per_record.png")


# >__Comment:__<br>
#     It might occur that accommodations for which less information is available online are less popular, assuming that number of reviews is a valid proxy for popularity.

# #### 4.2.3) Number of reviews per month by number of missing values per record
# ##### Analysis by visualization

# In[73]:


df.plot(x = 'missing_values', y = 'reviews_per_month', kind = 'scatter', color = 'green')

plt.xlabel('Missing values per record')
plt.ylabel('No. of reviews per month')
plt.savefig("no_of_reviews_per_month_by_missing_values_per_record.png")


# >__Comment:__
# - There is seemingly no data available on reviews per month for records (accommodations) in which more than cca. 30 values are missing.
# - Interestingly, not those records receive the most review per month which have the least missing values.

# #### 4.2.4) Average review score by number of missing values per record
# ##### Analysis by visualization

# In[74]:


df.plot(x = 'missing_values', y = 'review_scores_value', kind = 'scatter', color = 'grey')

plt.savefig("review_scores_value_by_missing_values_per_record.png")


# >__Comment:__<br>
#     There are seemingly no review scores values available in the dataset for records where are more than cca. 25 missing values in a record.

# ### 4.3) &nbsp; &nbsp; Question 3:
# Are there significant differences between the two citiesâ€™ apartment offers?

# #### 4.3.1) &nbsp; &nbsp; No. of unique hosts or listings

# >__Comments:__<br>
# The row or column `seattle` marks the differences in correaltions by the two investigated cities. The strongest relations with the listing being from Seattle (vs. Boston) are:
# - number of missing values (as `missing_values`): listings in Seatte tend to have less missing values
# - number of available days in 30 days (as `availability_30`): listings in Seattle are more likely to be available (similar but weaker correlation stands for `availability_60`)
# - number of listings by the host (as `host_listings_count`, `host_total_listings_count`, and `calculated_host_listings_count`): for listings in Seattle, the number is typically lower.

# ## 5) &nbsp; &nbsp; Evaluation

# __Answers to the questions:__
# 1. To which extent is data available on listings of Boston and Seattle Aribnbs? Is there a significant difference in the availability of data for the two cities?
# >- In the complete dataset the proportion of Boston and that of Seattle data are similar, around 50-50%.
# >- There are around 94 features available for both cities' datasets.
# >- The extent of missing data is very high for both cities. Beyond `listing_id`, price is the most widely available feature for the listing records although it only yields cca. 40% of all records.
# >- There are several features which are fully missing from the Boston dataset but are at least partially available for Seattle.
# 2. Does more information provision correlate with more favorable outcomes for a host? E.g. better prices, more reviews or better review score values
# >- There is no clear relation between the extent of missing values and prices.
# >- The availability of data does, however, correlate with the number of reviews and the monthly number of reviews. The listings for which a large proportion (cca. > 30-50%) of the features were missing did hardly not receive any reviews. Interestingly, the largest number of reviews were achieved by listings which had a few missing data entries while the most complete records did not beat the competition.
# >- In terms of average review scores, no clear pattern could be identified.
# 
# 3. Are there significant differences between the two citiesâ€™ apartment offers?
# >There are some significant differences in the listings available in Boston vs. in Seattle. Among the listings offered in Boston...
# >- there is a larger proportion of private rooms
# >- cancellation policy is flexible in a larger proportion.
# >The distribution of number of beds per listing and that of the number of reviews is similar for the two cities.
